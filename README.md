Hi, I'm Addie! I also go by Aria, but most people refer to me as Ari.
Age: 18
Gender: Female
Birthday 2 January 2006
Hobbies: Scale modelling, biking, and tinkering. I like putting things together.
Favourite colour: Purple! Especially vibrant chrome purple. Or azure blue.
Favourite season: Autumn. Spring is a close second, but I don't like rain.
Favourite time of day: Either right in the morning, just when the sun rises, or about half an hour before sunset.

Favourite tank: Good question. Most of them. Not the T-14 Armata. T14 Heavy is cool though.
Favourite game: Either War Thunder, Subnautica or Generation Zero. Depends on my mood.
Favourite franchise: Halo. Easily. Maybe Star Trek (but only if exclusively VOY and DS9 count).
Favourite song: Another Try by The Happy Fits.
